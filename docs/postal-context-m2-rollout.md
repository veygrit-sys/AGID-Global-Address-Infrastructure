# Postal Context M2 country rollout

The recurring task processes one country at a time in this order:

1. Asia (Japan first, then country/territory code order)
2. Europe
3. Americas
4. Africa
5. Oceania

The ledger is `docs/postal-context-m2-rollout.json` on the cumulative
`codex/postal-context-m2-rollout` branch of `veygrit-sys/Address-Grid-ID`.
Read the latest remote commit before every run. A local working copy may have
been removed after a verified push; an older user worktree is not the ledger.

## Scope and actual starting state

The first audit covers 252 registered country/territory profiles, including
repository-specific territory codes, not 252 ISO sovereign states. Antarctica
and the repository's special profiles are outside the five-region request.
The scheduling region is distinct from source ownership or sovereignty:
AS/GU/MP/UM run with Oceania, and EA runs with Africa. Their original profiles
are unchanged. All other profiles keep the repository's regional grouping.

At the initial audited base `cc7821cc8175031545d2a437fb5a4b10b6dfe5fe`,
110 country manifests exist and all declare M1. Only 61 spell out a named M2
stage. Missing manifests or criteria are work to do, not implicit success.
Some countries require assignment data; some require official postal geometry;
others allow an explicitly scoped experimental release. Preserve those
differences. Do not redefine M2 globally to make a country pass.

## State and resumption

- `pending`: not yet attempted in this rollout.
- `in_progress`: exactly one country; finish it before starting another.
- `blocked`: record concrete evidence, the missing permission/data/contract,
  the action needed to unblock, and an ISO timestamp `retryAfter`.
- `m2_verified`: the country's own criterion has been met by real data,
  reviewed source rights, published digest-pinned artifacts, reproducible
  validation and an AGID runtime verification record.

Visit pending countries across all regions before retrying due blockers.
Never poll the same unavailable source on every hourly wakeup. Prefer a
seven-day retry for unchanged source/licence blockers; do not retry permission
failures without new authority. Do not stop the whole rollout because one
country lacks an obtainable source. When all countries are either completed
or waiting for future review, report the next review date without claiming
completion. Pause the heartbeat only after every in-scope country has genuine
M2 evidence, or when the user asks to pause it.

The ledger checks required evidence fields, not the truth of arbitrary claims.
The executing agent must independently verify the linked artifacts and reports.
A stage label, source URL, code scaffold or passing synthetic fixture is not
M2 evidence. A no-postcode country must be reviewed against its actual system;
never invent an official code or silently mark it completed.

## Commands

```text
npm run postal-context:m2:status
npm run postal-context:m2:refresh
npm run verify:postal-context-m2
node scripts/intake-postal-context-jp-m2.mjs --report reports/postal-context-m2/<new-report>.json
node scripts/intake-postal-context-jp-m2.mjs --report <new-report>.json --expected-archive-digest sha256:<pinned-source-digest>
```

`refresh` regenerates inventory metadata and preserves progress. It refuses
duplicate countries, multiple active countries, missing proof for a completed
country, or removal of a previously tracked country. A changed M2 definition
for a completed country requires review.

## First country: Japan

The first implementation performs bounded official-source intake for the
[Japan Post UTF-8 ordinary assignment file](https://www.post.japanpost.jp/service/search/zipcode/download/utf-zip.html)
and pins the [field definitions and reuse notice](https://www.post.japanpost.jp/service/search/zipcode/download/readme.html).
It validates all 15 fields, seven-digit string codes, update flags, row/byte
limits and the single expected ZIP entry. It rejects altered rights text,
unapproved redirect hosts, malformed CSV and retired rows in a current file.

The normalizer preserves fallback, no-town, partial/qualified and multiple-town
semantics. An ordinary row without exception flags is still locality context,
not proof that a whole-town polygon is available. Building names, civic house
numbers, parcel identities and geometry are never inferred from the CSV.
The ordinary file does not include the separately published business-specific
assignment file.

The committed intake report contains counts, source/terms digests and validation
results only. The source archive, source locality rows and normalized JSONL
exist only in memory during this intake. No source snapshot or deployed pack
has been published by this step, so Japan remains M1 / `in_progress`.

Next: build scoped, non-synthetic Postal Context graph/descriptor artifacts;
exercise the pinned loader and API; establish an approved durable country-data
artifact location and retained source/terms evidence; verify remote digests;
only then review Japan's experimental M2 promotion. Nationwide code-existence
validation is not nationwide address, geometry or building coverage.

## Git, privacy and authority boundaries

Use an isolated worktree from the cumulative remote branch. Preserve every
pre-existing user change, including incomplete SDK and Luxembourg work. Keep
raw national dumps, personal/customer records and heavy indexes out of AGID
Git. Do not create repositories, paid services, public data destinations or
production deployments without explicit approval. No force pushes or merges
to main. Keep `origin` unchanged and push only to the explicit approved
`veygrit-sys/Address-Grid-ID` URL, SSH first and HTTPS if SSH is unavailable.

After focused/shared tests, typechecking and diff review, commit only completed
in-scope changes. Verify GitHub's exact branch SHA before removing that run's
temporary worktree, data and local branch. Never delete unpublished work or
existing user changes. Each report names the country, actual maturity,
remaining blockers, tests, branch, commit URL and next country/action.
