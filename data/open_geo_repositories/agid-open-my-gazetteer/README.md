# agid-open-my-gazetteer

Malaysia (MY) source-linked AGID gazetteer seed.

This repository records place names, AGID place identifiers, and geodata source
links for a P0 critical open-geodata gap. It is designed as a small,
reviewable country pack that can later be moved to GitHub as
`dawnportinfo-design/agid-open-my-gazetteer`.

## Scope

- Country AGID: `agid:country:MY`
- Priority: `P0-critical`
- Region kind: `country-or-main-region`
- Purpose: Record source-linked place names and AGID place identifiers for countries with critical open-geodata gaps.

This pack stores place-name metadata and source links only. It does not store
raw personal addresses, recipient records, proof witnesses, private keys,
carrier operational records, or precise private coordinates.

## Complete Country Slice

This pack is the eleventh complete P0 country slice. It includes:

- the country seed
- all 13 Malaysia states, source-linked and assigned AGID place IDs
- all 3 federal territories, source-linked and assigned AGID place IDs
- conformance vectors for every first-order division seed


## Files

- `manifest.json` - repository identity, AGID country link, and release gates

## Publication Status

not been imported. Importing or bundling external data requires license review.
